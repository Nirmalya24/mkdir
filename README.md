A desktop application that can create complex folder structures in seconds!

Choose a base path for your project and then add /folder_name/ (Mac And Linux) or \folder_name\ (Windows).
To create a folder you need to put "/" (Mac and Linux) or "\" (Windows) before and after the folder name otherwise it will create a file instead.
